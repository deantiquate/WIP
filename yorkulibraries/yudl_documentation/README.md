YUDL workflow documentation
========

This is a work-in-progress first attempt to make our digitization workflows and metadata policies more public and transparent.
We're going to focus on the Toronto Telegram because it is our biggest source of digitization and has the most complete metadata policy attached to it.


Features
--------

- Gather institutional knowledge about the history of the Toronto Telegram to populate a public FAQ
- Gather and publish internal reports and documentation about various pilot projects around digitization
- Collaborate across units to establish standards on digitization workflows
- Document our own policy changes, surface and celebrate the expertise within the Libraries, centralize our documentation to support a decentralized team of archivists, librarians, technicians and student assistants.
